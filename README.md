# K-FLIX

The topic of my thesis is a software application designed specifically for SMART
TVs, known as K-FLIX. I chose this name because the letter "K" represents the initial of
my last name, Kerekes, and I have always wanted to have my own company or business
that carries this name. The goal of K-FLIX is to offer users a modern and innovative
entertainment experience through a simple yet attractive interface that provides access
to movies and TV series. The uniqueness of the application lies in its focus on televisions,
creating an environment perfectly adapted to large-screen devices and remote controls.
